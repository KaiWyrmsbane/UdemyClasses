Habits to build:
create unit test as you create functions/classes!

SQL stuff:
localhost

Routing
Ex: 1 - [Route("api/[controller]")] , 2 - [HttpDelete("{id}")]
It would be read like this = [baseUrl]/api/[controller]/{id} so something like this
https://localhost:1234/api/products/2

Http verbs: Get, Post, Put, Delete

Controller endpoint examples: 
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult Get()
{
	//get all of something
}
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public IActionResult GetById(int id)
{
	//get something by this id
}
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create(Class/Object class/object)
{
	//Create a new object of this class
}
[HttpPut("{id}")]
public IActionResult Update(int id, Class class)
{
	//update an existing object
}
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
public IActionResult Delete(int id)
{
	//Delete a object by ID
}
